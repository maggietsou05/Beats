The company wanted to analyze customer reviews to guide product development and strategy for Beats' Pill Wireless Speakers. The dataset for this project was sourced/scraped from Amazon product reviews for various Beats by Dre audio devices. The dataset contains key information like review text, rating, helpful count, verified purchase status, and product attributes, used for sentiment analysis and insights into consumer experiences.

Key areas of this experience include:
- Leveraging web scrapers to collect consumer feedback from Amazon. Data was collected using the Oxylabs Scraper API, with a custom Python script to scrape and structure Amazon product reviews. [> full code](Amazon_Review_Scraper.ipynb)<br>
