# Beats
This project was completed as part of a consumer analytics externship with **Beats by Dre**, focused on understanding how leading brands decode customer conversations to guide product development and strategy.

In todayâ€™s consumer landscape, emotional resonance is just as critical as product specs. My role was to analyze authentic Amazon customer reviews of Beats speakers to uncover business insights.

Key areas of this experience include:
- Identifying product strengths and customer pain points
- Understanding brand perception through sentiment analysis
- Benchmarking against competitors
- Translating data into strategic recommendations and reports

Data was collected using the Oxylabs Scraper API, with a custom Python script to scrape and structure Amazon product reviews. The full code can be found [here](Amazon_Review_Scraper.ipynb).
The Python scripts utilized to clean the data can be found [here]
